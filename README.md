# Emotion Recognition from Speech
 Emotion recognition from speech
 
This is a Matlab implementation of the emotion recognition algorithm from 
Lech, Margaret et al. “Real-Time Speech Emotion Recognition Using a Pre-trained Image Classification Network: Effects of Bandwidth Reduction and Companding.” Frontiers in Computer Science (2020).
